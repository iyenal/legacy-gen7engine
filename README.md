# Legacy Gen7 Engine Archive

This repository contains several content around the legacy version of Gen7, developed from 2018 to 2021.
Their presence are only for archival purposes, since this version is heavily experimental and completely obsolete. They're hosted on Github as it's the only platform that should allow them their existence in the long term, compared to the frequent changes I operate on my servers, domains, etc...

Its not recommended to test the executables as their behavior and bugs are not completely known.
